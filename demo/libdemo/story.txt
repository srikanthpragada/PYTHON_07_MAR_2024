Kane is joint top of the Champions League scorers chart this season with six goals in eight matches, a feat matched by Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann.

Nobody across Europe's top five leagues has scored more top-flight goals than his 32 this campaign.

Arsenal striker Gabriel Jesus called Kane "the best finisher in the world" while manager Mikel Arteta said "his numbers over the past 10 years are unbelievable".

Despite Kane's goalscoring achievements, Bayern are very unlikely to secure a 12th consecutive Bundesliga title this season. They trail leaders Bayer Leverkusen by 16 points.

As for Arsenal, they are top of the Premier League on goal difference with seven games remaining.
